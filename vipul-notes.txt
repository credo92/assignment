WRONG: - using files to read_csv and not pandas which makes our lives easier
	   - no snake case style convention followed
	   - no meaninful variable names
	   - everything done in main which caused bloating of code
	   - code was hard to follow
	   - utils had only one function whereas it should have all utility functions that get data,create hist , etc
	   - test_utils was not at all relevant, we weren't testing at all like whether are we parsing data correctly, creating histogram correctly
	   
1. Didnt create class, because we are not instantiating any objects nor creating classes
2. Encapsulated all code in utils
3. Code runs in main
4. for test cases, created test data , imported functions and wrote assertions
5. Followed snake case style convention
6. created separate functions for getting data, creating hist
7. used pandas because its easier to read csv with pandas
8. added pandas in enivron yml file
9. for histogram, bins = 20 makes histogram legible and easy to follow
10. frequency on y axis in histogram basically shows how many males/females are there for that respective x variable ( age/height)
11. used pytest [test_utlis_path] commnad to execute test cases
